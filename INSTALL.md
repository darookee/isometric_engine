To build and use the demo of the engine you need SDL and CMAKE installed.


## Building on GNU/Linux

Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

```
 mkdir build
 cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ./isoengine
```

You can run 'make install' with root privileges to install the project
globally, but doing so is not recommended.
